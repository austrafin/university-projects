<h2>Prototype web site submission page</h2><br>
<p>This is to be placed in the top-level of your prototype web-space, that is,
where the index.html is.<br><br>

Here is the relative link to the index.html (the website Home Page):<br>
<p><a href="./index.php">Relative link to the Prototype's Front page</a> (I had a big problem when I double clicked on this html document instead of writing the path as "localhost/syrj0001/cover4prot.html" so if something weird happens, you might like to navigate through <a href="http://localhost/syrj0001/index.php">here</a>.

<p>In creating the prototypes, I/we implemented the following features (at least 2 for an individual,
3 for a pair)

<ol>
<li>Logging in with user name and password</li>
<li>Ability to add a new beer note (XML file) entry</li>
</ol>

(describe briefly each feature including the technique(s) used to implement this
feature (one list item per feature)) 

<ol>
<li>When the user logs in, the PHP function checks the entered user name and password for correctness. The password uses MD5 hashing. If they are correct, the login form is replaced with a "box" which shows a link to their user page and also a "Sign Out" button. Also, the link to the user page appears in the top navigational bar. If the user enters wrong credentials, the input fields turn red and a message "Wrong User Name or Password" appears. The colour change is done using JavaScript function.

<br><br>You can log in using following credentials:
<ol>
	<li>User: beer_lover Password: beer</li>
	<li>User: Boris Password: beer1</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The user fills a beer tasting form and based on that, a new XML file is created and presented in the beer notes listing. The form is created using HTML and XML file using PHP SimpleXML functions. The beer note can also be set private which means that it will appear in the users beer note list but not in the general list (unless they are beer notes by the user currently logged in). User can also delete their beer notes by clicking the cross next to a list item in their page. I have set up private beer notes for both, Boris and beer_lover.</li>
</ol>

This assignment was to introduce us to Trie and Suffix Trie data structures. The most interesting part of the assignment is the GUI where the user imports a text file and the program builds a dictionary as a suffix trie. This allows an impressive speed when the user searches for a particular word. When the user starts searching a word the program highlights every occurence of the strings the user has typed, and also lists the indexes of the sentence and character occurences.

This assignment explored Quicksort and Mergesort sorting algorithms in Java, Scheme and Prolog. The task was to compare the complexity and efficieny between the languages and the algorithms. Also, the difference in efficieny was explored by running the algorithms using recursion and iteration. Also, in the Java implementations comparison was made with both, ArrayLists and LinkedLists. Quicksort and Mergesort were also compared with less efficient sorting algorithms: Permuation Sort and Insertion Sort.

This project was the final assignment for the web-based software development course I took. It is a website prototype where users can submit their beer tasting notes and also get general information about beer. For this project I used HTML, CSS, XML, XSLT, JavaScript and PHP. It runs on an Apache web server. The information such as the beer notes and user information are stores as XML files. The following user names and passwords can be used to explore the website:

user name: beer_lover password: beer
user name: Boris password: beer1
